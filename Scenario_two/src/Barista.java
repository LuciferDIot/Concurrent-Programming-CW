/**
 * Represents a barista who prepares orders from the queue.
 *
 * Steps Achieved:
 * 1. Baristas prepare orders from the queue (Step 1 in the document).
 * 2. If the queue is empty, baristas wait until orders are available (handled in `CoffeeShop.prepareOrder`).
 *
 * Best Practices:
 * - Implement `Runnable` to allow the class to be executed in a separate thread.
 * - Handle `InterruptedException` to ensure threads can be interrupted gracefully.
